# Insurance Policy Billing and Collections Microservice

> **Assessment Project**: Design and architecture evaluation for a scalable policy billing and collections system

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains the architectural design and assessment for a comprehensive microservice that manages policy billing and collections for insurance operations. The system focuses on calculating recurring premiums, managing payment workflows, and handling delinquency processes through event-driven architecture.

## 🏗️ System Requirements

### Core Capabilities
- **Premium Calculation**: Recurring premium calculations based on policy metadata
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with multiple third-party payment providers
- **Collections Management**: Automated retry logic and grace period handling
- **Notification System**: Event-driven reminders and status updates

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MariaDB
- **Architecture**: Event-driven microservices with pub/sub messaging
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is currently in the design and assessment phase. Implementation guides and code samples will be added as the architecture is finalized.

## 🔧 Key Design Focus Areas

- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities for high-volume transactions
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and graceful degradation
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for multiple payment channels
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Data Consistency**: Event sourcing and eventual consistency patterns

## 📊 Architecture Complexity Levels

The system design includes three progressive architecture approaches:

1. **Simple**: MVP with basic functionality and single points of integration
2. **Medium**: Scalable with service decomposition and event-driven components
3. **Complex**: Enterprise-grade with full observability and multi-region capabilities
