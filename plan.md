# Policy Billing System Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development strategy for a microservice-based policy billing system with accompanying UI applications for testing and demonstration. The system prioritizes developer productivity, API validation, and iterative delivery while addressing production-ready concerns around testing, security, and maintainability.

---

## Strategic Architecture Overview

### System Vision
The UI applications are designed to exercise the billing system APIs with a focus on developer ergonomics and simplicity. In a production environment, these would likely be SPAs with a backend-for-frontend service, but for development and testing purposes, we're creating simple HTML applications that demonstrate API functionality.

### Service Architecture
- **Policy Service (Port 8081)**: Manages policy metadata, customer relationships, and premium schedules
- **Billing Service (Port 8082)**: Handles billing calculations, delinquency tracking, and grace period management  
- **Payment Service (Port 8083)**: Processes payments, retry logic, and transaction state management
- **Notification Service (Port 8084)**: Manages event-driven notifications and communication
- **Payment Gateway Mock (Port 8085)**: Simulates third-party payment processing

### Core Business Capabilities
- Calculate recurring premiums based on policy metadata
- Trigger payment reminders and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Record and track payments with comprehensive delinquency status
- Integrate with third-party payment providers through abstracted interfaces
- Event-driven notifications with pub/sub architecture for scalable messaging
- Grace period handling with configurable business rules
- Extensible payment channel support (credit card, ACH, digital wallets)

## Application Design Strategy

### Customer UI Application
**Target Users:** Insurance policyholders, customer service representatives, QA testers validating customer flows

**Core Functions:**
- View policy details and premium schedules with real-time status
- Make payments and view comprehensive payment history
- Manage payment methods and autopay settings with validation
- Receive billing notifications and alerts with preference management

**Hosting Service:** **Policy Service (Port 8081)**
- Rationale: Customer UI primarily deals with policy data and associated billing
- Policy service already handles policy metadata and premium schedules
- Natural fit for customer-centric operations with direct data access
- Can efficiently proxy billing/payment API calls to other services

### Admin UI Application
**Target Users:** Billing operations team, customer service managers, system administrators, developers testing internal APIs

**Core Functions:**
- View delinquent policies dashboard with filtering and search
- Manage payment retry operations with manual override capabilities
- Monitor payment processing status with real-time updates
- Generate billing reports and analytics with export capabilities
- Trigger manual billing operations with audit logging

**Hosting Service:** **Billing Service (Port 8082)**
- Rationale: Admin UI focuses on billing operations and system management
- Billing service handles premium calculations and delinquency tracking
- Contains the business logic for retry scheduling and grace period management
- Appropriate for internal operational tools with enhanced security requirements

## Technical Implementation Architecture

### API Design Standards
- **Versioning Strategy**: Semantic versioning (v1, v2) with backward compatibility
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification with Swagger UI integration
- **Response Format**: Standardized JSON with consistent error handling
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-service limits with graceful degradation

### Error Handling Strategy
- **UI-to-API Communication**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Service-to-Service**: Circuit breaker pattern with fallback mechanisms
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics collection, and alerting thresholds

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka for reliable event streaming
- **Event Types**: 
  - `payment.attempted`, `payment.succeeded`, `payment.failed`
  - `policy.delinquent`, `retry.scheduled`, `notification.sent`
- **Consumer Groups**: Service-specific with configurable retry policies
- **Schema Registry**: Avro schemas for event structure validation

## Alternative Architecture Considerations

### Option 1: Dedicated UI Service
**Pros:** Clean separation, independent scaling, unified asset management
**Cons:** Additional service complexity, extra deployment, overkill for simple UIs

### Option 2: API Gateway
**Pros:** Centralized routing, security, caching
**Cons:** Gateway becomes stateful, static asset handling complexity

### Option 3: Notification Service
**Pros:** Low traffic service, simple hosting
**Cons:** Doesn't align with UI functionality, confusing service boundaries

### Recommended Implementation
Start with proposed architecture (Policy Service ↔ Customer UI, Billing Service ↔ Admin UI) for simplicity and clear service boundaries, with option to migrate to dedicated UI service as system scales.

This approach prioritizes developer productivity and clear API exercise capabilities while maintaining production-ready architectural patterns.
