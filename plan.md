# UI Application Plan

## Overview

The UI applications are designed to exercise the billing system APIs with a focus on developer ergonomics and simplicity. In a production environment, these would likely be SPAs with a backend-for-frontend service, but for development and testing purposes, we're creating simple HTML applications that demonstrate API functionality.

## Application Architecture

### Customer UI Application
**Purpose:** Exercise customer-facing billing APIs and demonstrate end-user workflows

**Target Users:** 
- Insurance policyholders
- Customer service representatives
- QA testers validating customer flows

**Core Functions:**
- View policy details and premium schedules
- Make payments and view payment history
- Manage payment methods and autopay settings
- Receive billing notifications and alerts

**Hosting Service:** **Policy Service (Port 8081)**
- Rationale: Customer UI primarily deals with policy data and associated billing
- Policy service already handles policy metadata and premium schedules
- Natural fit for customer-centric operations
- Can easily proxy billing/payment API calls to other services

---

### Admin UI Application
**Purpose:** Exercise administrative and operational billing APIs for system management

**Target Users:**
- Billing operations team
- Customer service managers
- System administrators
- Developers testing internal APIs

**Core Functions:**
- View delinquent policies dashboard
- Manage payment retry operations
- Monitor payment processing status
- Generate billing reports and analytics
- Trigger manual billing operations

**Hosting Service:** **Billing Service (Port 8082)**
- Rationale: Admin UI focuses on billing operations and system management
- Billing service handles premium calculations and delinquency tracking
- Contains the business logic for retry scheduling and grace period management
- Appropriate for internal operational tools

---

## Technical Implementation

### Customer UI (`/customer-ui/`)
**Static Files Structure:**
```
policy-service/src/main/resources/static/customer-ui/
├── index.html (dashboard)
├── policies.html
├── policy-details.html
├── billing.html
├── payment.html
├── payment-history.html
├── login.html
├── styles.css
└── app.js (minimal JavaScript for API calls)
```

**API Integration:**
- Served by Policy Service static content handler
- Makes AJAX calls to `/api/policies/*`, `/api/billing/*`, `/api/payments/*`
- Cross-service API calls handled via service-to-service communication

### Admin UI (`/admin-ui/`)
**Static Files Structure:**
```
billing-service/src/main/resources/static/admin-ui/
├── index.html (admin dashboard)
├── delinquent-policies.html
├── retry-management.html
├── payment-monitoring.html
├── billing-reports.html
├── login.html
├── admin-styles.css
└── admin.js (JavaScript for admin operations)
```

**API Integration:**
- Served by Billing Service static content handler
- Makes AJAX calls to `/api/billing/*`, `/api/payments/*`, `/api/admin/*`
- Focus on operational and administrative endpoints

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Next Step:** Beginning Phase 2 - Unit Tests

**Key Assumptions Made:**
1. Using Spring Boot Test framework for unit and integration tests
2. TestContainers for database and Kafka integration tests
3. Mock data will simulate various policy states and payment scenarios
4. Async operations will use Spring's @Async and Kafka integration
5. UI will use vanilla JavaScript with fetch API for simplicity

---

## Developer Ergonomics

### Simplified Development Workflow
1. **No Build Process:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS files
2. **Hot Reload:** Static files served directly from classpath
3. **API Testing:** Forms and buttons directly call REST endpoints
4. **Error Handling:** Simple alerts and console logging
5. **Mock Data:** Embedded test data for offline development

### API Exercise Strategy
- Each UI page corresponds to specific API endpoints
- Form submissions demonstrate POST/PUT operations
- Tables and lists demonstrate GET operations with filtering
- Action buttons demonstrate DELETE and operational endpoints

### Testing Benefits
- **Manual Testing:** Easy to test API endpoints manually
- **Integration Testing:** UI can be used in automated tests
- **Demo/Documentation:** Visual representation of API capabilities
- **Debugging:** Clear visibility into API request/response cycles

## Service Hosting Rationale

### Why Policy Service for Customer UI?
- **Data Ownership:** Policy service owns customer policy data
- **API Proximity:** Most customer operations start with policy lookup
- **Logical Grouping:** Customer-facing vs admin-facing separation
- **Scalability:** Customer UI traffic patterns align with policy service scaling

### Why Billing Service for Admin UI?
- **Operational Focus:** Admin operations are billing-centric
- **Internal Tool:** Admin UI is internal-only, matches billing service security model
- **Data Access:** Billing service has direct access to delinquency and retry data
- **Maintenance:** Admin tools typically have different release cycles

---

## Alternative Hosting Options

### Option 1: Dedicated UI Service
**Pros:** Clean separation, independent scaling, unified asset management
**Cons:** Additional service complexity, extra deployment, overkill for simple UIs

### Option 2: API Gateway
**Pros:** Centralized routing, security, caching
**Cons:** Gateway becomes stateful, static asset handling complexity

### Option 3: Notification Service
**Pros:** Low traffic service, simple hosting
**Cons:** Doesn't align with UI functionality, confusing service boundaries

---

## Recommended Implementation

1. **Start with proposed architecture** (Policy Service → Customer UI, Billing Service → Admin UI)
2. **Add static content handlers** to both services
3. **Implement simple HTML pages** with minimal JavaScript
4. **Test API integration** through form submissions and AJAX calls
5. **Iterate based on developer feedback** and API testing needs

This approach prioritizes simplicity and developer productivity while providing clear API exercise capabilities for both customer and administrative workflows.
